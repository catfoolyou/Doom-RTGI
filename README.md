# Doom-RTGI
A patch for Sulim T's prboom-plus-rt that includes Doom 2 things, textures and flats
All credit goes to Sulim T for creating the original engine.

Because the original version did not include any of Doom 2's resources, many levels were pitch black and practically unplayable. I have solved this by creating the KTX2 files and updating the config.
